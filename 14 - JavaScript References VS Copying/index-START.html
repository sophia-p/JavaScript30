    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];


    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    console.log("original players is  " + players);
    const team2 = players.slice();
    console.log("team 2 is  " + team2);
    team2[3] = "Lux";
    console.log("team2 is now " + team2);
    console.log("players is " + players);

    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    console.log("team3 is " + team3);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const team4 = [...players];
    //spread takes every item out of iterable and puts it into containing array (in this case)
    console.log("team4 is " + team4)

    const team5= Array.from(players);
    console.log("team5 is " + players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
