    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];


    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    console.log("original players is  " + players);
    const team2 = players.slice();
    console.log("team 2 is  " + team2);
    team2[3] = "Lux";
    console.log("team2 is now " + team2);
    console.log("players is " + players);

    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    console.log("team3 is " + team3);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const team4 = [...players];
    //spread takes every item out of iterable and puts it into containing array (in this case)
    console.log("team4 is " + team4)

    const team5= Array.from(players);
    console.log("team5 is " + players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };
    
    // and think we make a copy:
        //start with blank obj, pass it obj you wish to copy all properties from, then fold in new properties to add/change
    const wes2 = Object.assign({},wes, {age:99});
    //ONLY for one-level deep. If twitter handle is changed here, it will be changed in wes
    console.log("wes2' twitter is + " + wes2.social.twitter)
    wes2.social.twitter = '@coolman';
    console.log("wes2's handle is " + wes2.social.twitter);
    console.log("wes' handle is " + wes.social.twitter);

    //could deep clone (though not that often necessary) or "poor man's deepl clone": JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes)) as a hack, turning it into string then back into obj.;

    //for one-level deep
    console.log("wes2 is " + wes2.age);
    console.log("wes is " + wes.age);
   

    const wes3 = {...wes};
    console.log("wes3 is " + wes3.age)


    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
